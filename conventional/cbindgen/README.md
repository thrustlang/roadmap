# Thrust Programming Language 

## Roadmap > Conventional Programming > Cbindgen

This article will explain how support for external types from C ``.h`` headers will be integrated, for full C integration into Thrust.


------------

- ``preprocessor.md``  Explains a bit about how the compiler will be able to process C headers from scratch to integrate them with Thrust code.

- ``codegeneration.md`` Briefly explains how the compiler will be able to compile the already organized AST of C-type headers to compile them with the current code generator selected in the Thrust compiler.
