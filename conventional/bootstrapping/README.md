# Thrust Programming Language 

## Roadmap > Conventional Programming > Compiler Bootstrapping

This technique involves the ability to create a primary compiler to write another compiler, which allows processing the main language. This technique underlies many programming languages.

For reasons like these, C is written in C, Rust in Rust, and C++ in C++.

### It's a huge work

In fact, yes. It's a huge undertaking—I dare say it's more extensive than any other Thrust update—since it involves porting all the Thrust compiler code from Rust to Thrust. Which makes it a stupidly crazy undertaking.

To a certain extent, it's hoped that there will already be a community willing to fully contribute to the project. Otherwise, it won't happen until the right one is created.

### Priority

This phase of development of the programming language and compiler is not a high priority and is not expected to be implemented in the near future. However, it will continue in the coming years.
