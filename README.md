# Thrust Programming Language | Roadmap

This repository serves as an explanation of the major development stages the compiler will face in the future. It covers aspects of conventional programming, including new features from Thrush, as well as quantum programming and its potential use in future compiler and language development.

> [!WARNING]  
> These enormous development stages in the development of the language and compiler do not influence its early deployment to BETA as soon as possible. If you want to find out when the programming language is released in BETA, see `conventional/README.md`.

------------------

- ``conventional/`` It covers the future of compiler and language development in mainstream programming and the aspects Thrush will highlight.
- ``quantum/`` It covers the future of compiler and language development in quantum programming, in the aspects that Thrush will feature.
