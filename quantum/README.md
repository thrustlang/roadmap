# Thrust Programming Language | Roadmap > Quantum Programming

This article will briefly discuss the integration of quantum programming into Thrush and its ways to break into the spotlight in this cutting-edge technology sector.

------------------

``backends.md`` This article will briefly explain the backends and code generators available for quantum code generation and intermediate representation. It will also discuss applications that use [Q#](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp) to model code generation. 

``qir/README.md`` Explains how QIR (Quantum Intermediate Representation), created by the QIR Alliance, can be used to standardize compiler design with a focus on quantum computing, using LLVM as an intermediary.
